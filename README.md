# Sunrise-Sunset
Python program to display and plot sunrise and sunset data.

Requires: Python (tested on 2.7 and 3.7) and matplotlib. 

The necessary calculations are all contained in the sun_rise_set.py file.  

There are a few ways to use this repository:
1) Import sun_rise_set.py to create your own program.
2) Use cmd_line_parser.py to generate console output for any location between the Arctic Circle and Antarctic Circle.
3) Use sunrise_gui_cli.py to generate a plot for any location between the Arctic Circle and Antarctic Circle.

Here are some examples:

### Plot of New York City, 2020: see sunrise_gui_nyc.py
